GraspLiftAndTouchEnv models a sub-task from laparoscopic chole-
cystectomy, i.e., the minimally invasive removal of the gallbladder. Dur-
ing dissection of the yellow gallbladder from the red liver, the blue
grasper has to grasp the distal end (infundibulum) of the partially re-
sected gallbladder. Afterwards, the grasper retracts the gallbladder,
exposing a visual marker, which represents the point that should be
cut next. The green electrocautery hook then navigates to the visual
marker and activates in order to cut the tissue. The task is complete
when the target is visible to the camera and the cauter activates while
touching it.
