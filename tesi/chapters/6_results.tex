\chapter{Results and Future Directions}

Simulation-based pretraining to reduce real-world data collection costs.
Transfer learning from simpler robotic tasks (e.g., grasping) to more complex surgical tasks.
Safety-aware RL methods (constrained policies) to minimize surgical risk.
Domain adaptation techniques to handle variations in patient anatomy and real-time changes.
Hybrid approaches that blend model-based and model-free RL for adaptive decision-making and uncertainty handling.



\textbf{ASSUMPTIONS THROUHGOUT THE EXPERIMENTS}
PRIMI DUE ENV
- deformation of the environment is the only source of uncertainty
- the agent doesn't affect deformation 
- deformation are topologically sound
