\chapter*{Thesis Outline and Summary}

% There are two major areas that contribute to the advancement of automating surgical procedures: 
% perception and task automation. Perception aims at understanding the surgical situation based on 
% a variety of inputs during the surgery (endoscopic cameras, tactile feedback etc). This may also include 
% the detection, and tracking of surgical tools, as well as 3D reconstruction of the deformed tissue. 
% Task automation, on the other hand, involves automating the surgical robot to accomplish specific tasks, 
% given the knowledge of the surgical situation. 

% Our work focuses on brigding the gap between these two areas, by developing a framework that 
% integrates perception and task automation in a single pipeline through the use of Partially Observable 
% Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL).
