This thesis explores the application of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes 
(POMDPs) to enhance decision-making in robotic-assisted surgery, specifically addressing 
the challenges posed by deformable environments and partial observability. 
The research focuses on developing RL-based strategies to improve the adaptability, 
robustness, and precision of robotic surgical systems in deformable tissue interactions. 
The study begins by establishing a theoretical foundation in Markov Decision Processes 
(MDPs) and POMDPs, discussing key concepts and solution methods. The experimental section 
involves testing RL algorithms in simulated environments, including a gridworld and 
a deformable maze, to evaluate their performance under increasing complexity. 
The results highlight the potential of POMDP-based RL in handling deformable environments, 
while also underscoring the computational challenges and the need for more advanced simulation techniques and efficient POMDP solvers.
