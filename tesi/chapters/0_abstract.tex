Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with surgical
resection offering the best chance for cure in early-stage cases. However, the 
intraoperative environment presents significant challenges, including dynamic 
anatomical changes, limited visibility, and high stakes for patient safety. Assistive 
technologies capable of real-time decision-making and adaptability could greatly 
enhance surgical outcomes. In this context, this thesis explores the potential of 
Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes and Reinforcement Learning 
as frameworks for developing intelligent, adaptive, and safe intraoperative AI driven 
systems to support surgeons in Robotic Assisted Surgery.
